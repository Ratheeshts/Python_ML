# Regression
Regression searches for relationships among variables. Regression problems usually have one continuous and unbounded dependent variable. The inputs, however, can be continuous, discrete, or even categorical data such as gender, nationality, brand, and so on.
  Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. For example, you could try to predict electricity consumption of a household for the next hour given the outdoor temperature, time of day, and number of residents in that household.
  imple Linear Regression
Simple or single-variate linear regression is the simplest case of linear regression with a single independent variable, 𝐱 = 𝑥.

The following figure illustrates simple linear regression:
